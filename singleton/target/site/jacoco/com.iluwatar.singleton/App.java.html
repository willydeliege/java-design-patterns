/**
 * &lt;p&gt;Singleton pattern ensures that the class can have only one existing instance per Java
 * classloader instance and provides global access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;One of the risks of this pattern is that bugs resulting from setting a singleton up in a
 * distributed environment can be tricky to debug since it will work fine if you debug with a
 * single classloader. Additionally, these problems can crop up a while after the implementation of
 * a singleton, since they may start synchronous and only become async with time, so it may
 * not be clear why you are seeing certain changes in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to implement the Singleton. The first one is the eagerly initialized
 * instance in {@link IvoryTower}. Eager initialization implies that the implementation is thread
 * safe. If you can afford to give up control of the instantiation moment, then this implementation
 * will suit you fine.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The other option to implement eagerly initialized Singleton is enum-based Singleton. The
 * example is found in {@link EnumIvoryTower}. At first glance, the code looks short and simple.
 * However, you should be aware of the downsides including committing to implementation strategy,
 * extending the enum class, serializability, and restrictions to coding. These are extensively
 * discussed in Stack Overflow: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/179386/what-are-the-downsides-of-implementing
 * -a-singleton-with-javas-enum&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link ThreadSafeLazyLoadedIvoryTower} is a Singleton implementation that is initialized on
 * demand. The downside is that it is very slow to access since the whole access method is
 * synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Another Singleton implementation that is initialized on demand is found in
 * {@link ThreadSafeDoubleCheckLocking}. It is somewhat faster than {@link
 * ThreadSafeLazyLoadedIvoryTower} since it doesn't synchronize the whole access method but only the
 * method internals on specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Yet another way to implement thread-safe lazily initialized Singleton can be found in
 * {@link InitializingOnDemandHolderIdiom}. However, this implementation requires at least Java 8
 * API level to work.&lt;/p&gt;
