/**
 * Singleton pattern ensures that the class can have only one existing instance per Java classloader
 * instance and provides global access to it.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;One of the risks of this pattern is that bugs resulting from setting a singleton up in a
 * distributed environment can be tricky to debug since it will work fine if you debug with a single
 * classloader. Additionally, these problems can crop up a while after the implementation of a
 * singleton, since they may start synchronous and only become async with time, so it may not be
 * clear why you are seeing certain changes in behavior.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to implement the Singleton. The first one is the eagerly initialized
 * instance in {@link IvoryTower}. Eager initialization implies that the implementation is thread
 * safe. If you can afford to give up control of the instantiation moment, then this implementation
 * will suit you fine.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The other option to implement eagerly initialized Singleton is enum-based Singleton. The
 * example is found in {@link EnumIvoryTower}. At first glance, the code looks short and simple.
 * However, you should be aware of the downsides including committing to implementation strategy,
 * extending the enum class, serializability, and restrictions to coding. These are extensively
 * discussed in Stack Overflow:
 * http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/179386/what-are-the-downsides-of-implementing
 * -a-singleton-with-javas-enum
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link ThreadSafeLazyLoadedIvoryTower} is a Singleton implementation that is initialized on
 * demand. The downside is that it is very slow to access since the whole access method is
 * synchronized.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Another Singleton implementation that is initialized on demand is found in {@link
 * ThreadSafeDoubleCheckLocking}. It is somewhat faster than {@link ThreadSafeLazyLoadedIvoryTower}
 * since it doesn't synchronize the whole access method but only the method internals on specific
 * conditions.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Yet another way to implement thread-safe lazily initialized Singleton can be found in {@link
 * InitializingOnDemandHolderIdiom}. However, this implementation requires at least Java 8 API level
 * to work.
